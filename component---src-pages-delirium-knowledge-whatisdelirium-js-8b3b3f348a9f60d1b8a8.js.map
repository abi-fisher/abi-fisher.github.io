We know this increases dopamine levels and decreased acetylcholine levels. \n        This can disrupt the functioning of the thalamus (controller of information to the cerebral cortex) and permeability of the blood-brain barrier and leads onto delirium.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Opiates used in surgery and post op care are strongly associated with delirium. \n        They often change the levels of serotonin and acetylcholine and therefore, may cause delirium. Changes in sleep pattern can also reduce acetylcholine and melatonin levels, \n        therefore exacerbating delirium.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It must be noted that older people also produce less acetylcholine than that of younger adults, and the fasting process also reduces this hormone in the brain.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The link between anesthesia itself and delirium is still unclear. We know that regional anesthesia has a reduced risk of developing delirium that general anaesthesia, \n        but this may only be due to the usage of muscle relaxants in GA may cause hypoxemia, which has been linked to delirium causation. \n        Other medication used intra-op or post-op such as CNS depressant drugs, antihypertensives, digoxin and antihistamines have been linked to causing delirium too.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"info-section\">\n      <h3>Delirium vs Dementia</h3>\n      <p>\n        You may have heard the saying ‘Dementia impacts memory, delirium impacts awareness’. \n        This statement is true, but we should delve a little deeper into the specifics\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There are three main differences between the two diagnoses:\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Onset</strong> - Dementia is slow to progress, it develops over years; delirium is acute and can occur within hours\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Fluctuation</strong> - Patients living with dementia have ‘good’ and ‘bad’ parts of the day for behaviour e.g. sundowning. \n            Patients with delirium can fluctuate in behaviour within minutes e.g. drowsy to wandering.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Attention</strong> - Delirium impacts awareness severely, you may notice a significant change in level of awareness in your patient with delirium. \n            However, patients living with dementia have a consistent level of attention span, but this will change as the disease progresses\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The main points to remember:\n        <ul>\n          <li>Delirium and dementia are <strong>not</strong> the same!</li>\n          <li>You can have both dementia and delirium</li>\n          <li>It can be difficult to decipher between the two, ask relatives/carers about your patients’ baseline of cognition if unsure</li>\n          <li>Delirium should be treated before dementia</li>\n          <li>Dementia impacts memory, delirium impacts awareness</li>\n          <li>A referral to the Mental Health Liaison Team may assist in diagnosis questioning</li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
